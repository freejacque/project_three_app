[ChemPop](https://secure-shore-1088.herokuapp.com/)
=================
ChemPop is a one-page app made using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and Sinatra. A player is assigned a set of random cards, consisting of elements. The player must use the charges of the ions these elements will form to create ionic compounds. This can be accomplished by dragging cards to the three gray squares on the right side of the screen.
